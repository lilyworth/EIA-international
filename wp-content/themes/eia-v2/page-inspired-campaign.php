                <h2>Join EIA in the fight against wildlife crime</h2>
                <p class="lwstrong">Join us as we expose the criminals who threaten our planet.</p>
                <p>From deforestation and climate change to protecting endangered species and oceans, we’re committed to investigating and exposing any activity that harms our planet. But we need your help.</p>
                <p>Our investigators work in very challenging conditions to expose illegal practices – often providing valuable information to Interpol and customs agencies worldwide. But we rely on the generous support of the public. It costs between £10,000 and £20,000 to run a single investigation and, without the generosity of people who care about protecting our planet, criminal networks will continue to operate with impunity despite the damage they cause. So please, help us fight environmental and wildlife crime with a gift today.</p>

                    <p>The more complex cases can see investigators setting up false front companies and produce well-researched fake identities, allowing them to infiltrate criminal organisations and get close to the key individuals involved.</p>
